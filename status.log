2021-01-23 15:11 CET - Fixing bug: it's possible to elect two different leaders in the same term
Problem: term may change while replicating, and we end up sending AppendEntries for a term for which we're not leader.

2021-01-24 17:03 CET - Deciding whether to continue with log listener, or to set up more thorough test infrastructure.
At first I though about implementing DPOR, but now I think maybe a random scheduler would be enough to get started?
I think so - certainly we'll get more interleavings this way than with real timers.
With current message passing implementation we only need to mock out timers, so it should be easy.
